# Work record of Github participation
This document is also practice of GFM(Github Flavored Markdown).
## Set the name and email address to use with Git
The name and e-mail address set here will be published when the repository is published on GitHub, so make sure that it is published and there is no problem.
(It seems good to use a handle name as the name.)
Also, it seems better to use English letters. (Because it is a common language in the world.) 
```console
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
```
