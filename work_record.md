## Set the name and email address to use with Git
The name and e-mail address set here will be published when the repository is published on GitHub.
(It seems good to use a handle name as the name.)
Also, it seems better to use English letters. (Because it is a common language in the world.) 
1. Set the name
```console
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
```

2. Confirm the name
```console
$ git config --global user.name
```

3. Set email address
```console
$ git config --global user.email my_email_address
```

4. Confirm email address
```console
$ git config --global user.email
```

5. You can also set and check by the following method.
```console
$ vim ~/.gitconfig
```
